Effect of data balance in Machine Learning
==========================================

#### Manifesto

Because *Human* is **perfectible** and **error-prone**, because *Science* should be **open** and **flow** and because *cogito ergo sum*.

## Research target output

This study targets ACPR2015 to be scientifically disseminated

## Datasets
Datasets would be taken from [mldata.org]
[mldata.org]:mldata.org

### Some thoughts:

- checkout [mldata.org]. Iâ€™ve troubles to connect
- [List of highly imbalanced data sets](http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~zding/research/benchmark-data.php)
- [UCI dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=cla&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=attup&view=list) described as imalanced (137)
- Scikit-learn has some [dataset loading utilities](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/) which also refair to [svmlight-loader](https://github.com/mblondel/svmlight-loader) as example.
- [SciKit-data](https://github.com/jaberg/skdata) is a package for loading/creating datasets for scikit-learn

* sobhani claims that using abalone as ring=19 the imbalance turns 1:130? 
* guo and liu sizes disagree at phoneme and abalone. 
* guo and sobhani yeast size difers
* car sobhani says 1:25
* breast-cancer UCI is 683 elements and can be found at svmlitle
* `---` is stuff to be checked

### Recomendations

#### Use a virtual environment (Virtualenv + VirtualenvWrapper)

Virtual-environments are not **virtual machines**.
Virtual-environments are used to avoid library classing between the libraries of a project and those fom the system.
Find more information in this [virtual environment post] describing how to use virtual environment for a [mozilla marketplace testing].

Use the following to create a `data_balancing` environment based on the `./requirements.txt` associated with the source directory `./src`:

```
mkvirtualenv data_balancing -a src -r ../requirements.txt
```

Notice that `mkvirtualenv` activates such environment.
The command `deactivate` is used to exit the virtual environment.
Once the virtual environment exist on the system, the command `workon data_balancing` is rather convenient since it jumps into the working directory and activates the virtual enviroment.

**Remember** to keep `requirements.txt` up to date.
For more details regarding the usage of the virtual enviroment, please look at the [command reference].

Todo
----

- [x] Add virtual-env behaviour (at /src)
- [?] Add sphinx documentation as project.io website
- [x] Add paper submodule
  - [ ] apply ACPR2015 template
- [ ] Add code modules
- [ ]
